# Tetris

My Unity project aimed to refresh what I know about C# and Unity.

## Description

This is just a regular tetris of my implementation)

## Installation

This project works only on Windows currently (Will probably add a Linux build in some future).

Program is already built and located in Builds/ folder.

## Usage

Move tetris figures to destroy the lines and dont let them get above the red line!
